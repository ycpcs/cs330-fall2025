Ethics and Legal Responsibilities Assignment
====================================

**Due: Thursday, Aug 28, 2025 by 6:00 PM**

Purpose
-----------
In this course, you will gain hands-on experience with networking tools, protocols, and techniques—including some that have been used in real-world cyberattacks. Understanding these concepts is essential for building secure and robust systems. However, with this knowledge comes ethical and legal responsibility.

Legal and Institutional Guidelines
-----------
You are expected to act lawfully and ethically at all times. Activities such as probing, exploiting, or intercepting data on unauthorized systems—even if done with good intentions—can be violations of:

- **Federal Law**, such as the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act [CFAA]( http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=(title:18%20section:1030%20edition:prelim)).
- **York College's [Acceptable Use Policy](https://service.ycp.edu/TDClient/219/Portal/KB/ArticleDet?ID=7381)**
- **International regulations and industry codes of conduct**
  
Unauthorized use of these techniques can result in serious consequences, including expulsion, civil or criminal penalties, and jail time.

If you are ever unsure whether an action is permitted or ethical, **consult your instructor first**.

Notable Real-World Cases (abbreviated and contextualized)
-----------
Here are some examples of individuals who faced serious consequences for unethical or illegal use of computer networking knowledge:
