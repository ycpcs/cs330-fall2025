Academic Integrity
-----------------

At York College, we uphold a strict policy of academic honesty. All students are expected to adhere to these principles, and any form of academic dishonesty will not be tolerated. Academic dishonesty includes, but is not limited to, cheating, plagiarism, fabricating research, and falsifying academic documents. This encompasses any situation where students present someone else's work as their own.

**Policy on Homework and Individual Lab Assignments:**

- **Individual Work Required:** All graded individual programming assignments must be completed independently. While discussing high-level concepts with peers is encouraged, all submitted work must be your own.

- **Prohibition on Copying:** Direct copying of code or work from other students, websites, or any other sources is strictly prohibited.

- **Source Acknowledgment:** Any sources consulted (books, websites, articles, fellow students, etc.), excluding the course textbook and lecture notes, must be properly acknowledged. It is advisable to use only the resources listed in the course syllabus or on the course web page. Your programming assignments must reflect your own work, not adaptations of others’ work.

**Non-Graded Lab Assignments:**

- Non-graded lab assignments may allow collaboration with other students. However, it is your responsibility to complete them, and you are encouraged to use class time to work on these labs and ask questions.
  
**Handling Academic Dishonesty:**

- If a faculty member suspects a student of academic dishonesty, they will notify the student in writing. The faculty member must then report the incident to the Dean of Academic Affairs and the Department Chair within ten business days of notifying the student. Documentation of academic dishonesty will be maintained in the student's permanent record.

- For a first offense, the faculty member may impose a suitable sanction, including potentially awarding a grade of 0 for the course. Students are not allowed to withdraw from a course in which they have been accused of academic dishonesty.

If at any point you are unsure whether something is allowed under the academic integrity policy, please ask your instructor!

For the full policy, go to the Academic Standards section of the current Course Catalog [https://www.ycp.edu/about-us/offices-and-departments/registrar/catalogs/](https://www.ycp.edu/about-us/offices-and-departments/registrar/catalogs/).

Attendance and Participation
-----------------
Regular attendance and active participation in class are crucial for your success. Please inform me in advance if you need to miss a class. You are responsible for all material covered, regardless of your attendance.

If you consistently attend and participate, you will receive full credit for attendance and participation. However, frequent absences or lack of participation will negatively impact your credit in these areas.

Students are expected to attend every class. One unexcused absence is permitted without penalty. After that, each additional unexcused absence will result in a deduction of 2% from your final grade, up to a maximum of 10%. If you anticipate needing to miss more classes (e.g., due to illness, work, or personal responsibilities), contact the instructor in advance to discuss alternative accommodations.

You are responsible for keeping up with the reading assignments as described in the course schedule.

Professionalism
-----------------

I expect you to conduct yourself as a professional in this course. Professionalism includes:

-   Respect for and courteous interaction with peers, faculty and facilities;
-   Integrity, which includes at its core honesty, responsibility and accountability for one’s own actions;
-   Sensitivity and appreciation for diverse cultures, backgrounds, and life experiences;
-   Constructive evaluation, which means that criticism is offered and accepted in a productive manner;
-   Self-reflection and identification of one’s own strengths and weaknesses;
-   Responsibility for one’s own education and learning;
-   An attitude that fosters professional behavior in colleagues and peers;
-   Punctuality at meetings and class sessions;
-   Attentive behavior during class sessions, avoiding personal or social use of cell phones, laptops, or other electronic devices;
-   Acknowledgement of the Kinsley Engineering Center as a professional workplace, and treatment of this facility as a business or office space, not as an informal space.

I reserve the right to enforce this code through the York College Code of Student Conduct.

Use of Personal Technology in the Classroom
-----------------

While York College recognizes students' need for educational and emergency-related technological devices such as laptops, PDAs, cellular phones, etc., using them unethically or recreationally during class time is never appropriate. The college recognizes and supports faculty members' authority to regulate in their classrooms student use of all electronic devices.

Communication Standards
-----------------

York College recognizes the importance of effective communication in all disciplines and careers. Therefore, students are expected to competently analyze, synthesize, organize, and articulate course material in papers, examinations and presentations. In addition, students should know and use communication skills current to their field of study, recognize the need for revision as part of their writing process, and employ standard conventions of English usage in both writing and speaking. Students may be asked to further revise assignments that do not demonstrate effective use of these communication skills.

Student Accessibility Services
-----------------

York College of Pennsylvania offers a variety of academic accommodations to students with documented disabilities to ensure their success. To request accommodations, please contact Student Accessibility Services at (717) 815.1717 or <sas@ycp.edu>. Student Accessibility Services will discuss the confidential process of requesting accessibility services and establish the accommodations for which the student is eligible.

Advice
-----------------
- **Start Projects Early**: Don’t wait until the last minute to begin your projects. They can be time-consuming, so it’s important to pace yourself. Procrastination often leads to unnecessary stress and lower quality work.

- **Ask Questions**: If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to ask. Engaging actively with the material helps deepen your understanding.

- **Engage in Discussions**: Participate actively in class discussions. Avoid relying on slides to answer questions; instead, contribute your thoughts and insights directly.
